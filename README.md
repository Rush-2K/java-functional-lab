# ☕ Java Learning Lab

This repository serves as my personal development scratchpad. It is a collection of independent projects and exercises focused on mastering **Modern Java**, specifically **Functional Programming** and the **Stream API**.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo
Each folder in this repository is a **standalone Maven project**. To run or explore a specific project:

1. Navigate to the specific project folder (e.g., `cd java-streams-tutorial`).
2. Open the `pom.xml` in that folder as a project in IntelliJ/Eclipse.
3. Run the tests or main classes individually.

## 💡 Why this exists?
The goal is to move away from imperative "for-loop" thinking and master the power of `java.util.stream`. This repo helps me:
- Save "recipes" for complex Stream operations.
- Practice writing cleaner, more readable Java code.
- Track my progress through various tutorials and courses.
